    <content>Been working on this mod quite a bit after some great input from the user SunPraise!
Generally the automatic loading and unloading of the carts now has more options and behaves more logical. There are now also mod-options for some aspects of these new features.

There are more ideas for the mod and if I get the time it will hopefully see more additions in the future! For a full list of the changes, please see the Changenotes on the mod-page or Github-repo.</content>
